# BookListing App

Author: Wenshuo Chen

### Description

The Book Listing app allows a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. I am using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started#intro) in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

### How to build:

This project is not published to Google Play Store yet. You can download the repository to your computer. Run Android Studio to generate the apk file on your phone.
